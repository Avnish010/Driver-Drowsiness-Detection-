# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
In this Python project, I created a drowsy driver alert system  that can be used to detect drowsiness of a person .I have used OpenCV  and dlib library to detect  faces and eyes, and then a CNN model to predict the state. The  model was enhanced by adding additional datasets, which were  used to train and test the model with different iterations.
